Steps:
1. Binary Noise Mask Matrix was calculated.
2. The Binary Noise Mask Matrix was passed along with the training data to the transformer based autoencoder for training. The Generator learns the underlying distribution of normal patterns in the time series data and reconstructs it precisely. he Discriminator imposes constraints on the reconstructions generated by the Generator, distinguishing between real (normal) and fake (reconstructed) time series data.
3. Contrastive constraints were imposed on representations of time series data to encourage meaningful and distinguishable latent representations
4. Anomalies are identified based on deviations from the learned normal patterns.
